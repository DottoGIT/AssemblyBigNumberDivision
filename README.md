## ASMx86 and RISC-V calculators for dividing 32 digits numbers
This repository contains two calculators designed for dividing large numbers across different bases:

## ASMX86-32 Calculator
A 32-bit assembly language calculator implemented in ASMX86-32. It supports division of up to 32-digit numbers across any numerical base. It is implemented as a funciton inside [main.cpp](ASMx86-32/main.cpp)
* Handles division of large numbers with precision.
* Supports multiple numerical bases.

## RISC-V Calculator
A calculator implemented in RISC-V assembly language for dividing large numbers. It specifically handles division of base-10 numbers.
* Efficient division of large base-10 numbers.
* Optimized for RISC-V architecture.
